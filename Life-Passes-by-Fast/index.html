Life would be much better if we lived like there is no tomorrow. But we don’t actually believe that we will die soon. Why is that?</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>To be clear, I don’t mean that you will die tomorrow. It’s that you don’t know if you will. So you live like only doing things that matter. You’ll not waste your time then. We waste it because there’s always tomorrow in our minds.</p>
<p>Is it because we’re afraid of death so much that we like to keep it in a fog? Death is an unknown thing because we haven’t died yet. How can we be afraid of something which we don’t know? The fact is, we’re afraid of losing the things we know of. However painful, however petty, it’s the only thing that I know. I recommend reading this if you’re interested in this part: The meaning of death.</p>
<p>Do we waste our time because we’re easily satisfied with little things? But I’m not talking to those people who’re happy with their petty job and their petty life. Fuck them. You should be unsatisfied with certain things.</p>
<p>I’m talking about a sense of urgency to not waste your life. To never waste your time. Is it about reminding yourself every day that we’re mortal, that our life is limited? Are we aware that life is short? For people who were too lazy to click on the link:</p>
<p>You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as- magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p>
<p>So, life is short.</p>
<p>If you have less of something precious, you’ll be careful about wasting it. This is an axiom.</p>
<p>Life is long enough that every day of our life feels the same as the previous few days. You notice the difference when you remember “oh man, it’s been six years since then”. And it jabs your mind like a pin. Each day is different, and what it means is that you are not the same person every day. The change is unnoticeable, but it’s there. Don’t get surprised when your birthday is nearing.</p>
<p>We waste time because each singular day or hour feels insignificant. And it is. So procrastinating doesn’t feel that big of a deal. But how you live your day is how you live your life. If you waste time, then you’re the sort of person who wastes time. You’ll waste it tomorrow again. Nothing is gonna change.</p>
<p>Your life is not only your life but also the life of a human being. You are a member of the human race. And if you change, you are adding to the consciousness of mankind and it is not a trivial thing. What it means is that your life is precious. It’s the life of a human being. How can you stand wasting one minute of it?</p>
<p>So it is precious and short. That is clear.</p>
<p>Let’s say it is certain you’ll die in about 80 years from now. Should you still follow your biological impulse to argue with someone on Twitter? Probably not, I hope.</p>
<p>It is our short term impulsive nature that we waste time. When death is close our minds are suddenly focused on the things that matter most but not so much when far away.</p>
<p>I was watching a video in which a girl said she’ll not eat animals.</p>
<p>“How about fish?” her mother asked.</p>
<p>‘Fish? Is it an animal?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘I won’t eat that either.’</p>
<p>You can watch it here: “I Won’t Eat Animals,” Girl Tells Her Mother</p>
<p>This rejection comes from deep sensitivity. Is it possible to feel this same level of sensitivity with our time?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Let’s take arguing online for example. Is it a good idea? Does it matter if you win the argument? One heuristic to find out if something matters is to ask: Does it matter in the future? When you realize it has no meaning, you stop immediately.</p>
<p>Coming back to sensitivity. It comes from deep-rooted love. And if you love your life and understand its finiteness and what’s done is done — you’ll not do meaningless things. I define wasting time as doing things that are not meaningful. This is the most fundamental way to think about it.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem is finding meaning in your life, and it can be in your responsibility or art. Your heart will always know.</p>
<p>So you have to make the decision about what you’re going to do around what truly matters to you, what you love to do. Then you’ll have the same sensitivity as the little girl.</p>
