Trying to kill every day is stupid.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>I learned this on Joe Rogan podcast and it is life-changing, let’s say the maximum pull-ups you can do is 10. If I had a gun to your head, you couldn’t do 11. Then on the first day, you should do 5. So you’ll not be sore and can attempt the next day too. And when you’ve mastered 5, then only move to 6. And this is sustainable for months every day. Even Joe was surprised listening to this.</p>
<p>I always thought if I do this way I’ll waste a lot of time. But I’ll waste so much more time if I don’t follow this — and for years. Going big the first day when you feel motivated is stupid because it’s just not sustainable every day. I have wasted years not understanding this. Only incremental growth every week is sustainable every day. And you can go farther than you can imagine in a year.</p>
<p>This is the reason that you should start small, you can sustain it.</p>
<p>Every day one must go into the unknown. If not every day at least a week. By the unknown, I mean something new. When you push yourself in working out you’re going into the unknown. You’re discovering something new about yourself or what you are exploring. As Jiddu Krishnamurti said, “All knowledge is self-knowledge”. So everything you do should always have something that you haven’t done before. Then it is engaging. Unknown is fun and engaging. And happiness comes from engagement. Engagement is a necessity for consistency. If you’re not having fun, you’ll get bored fast.</p>
<p><b>Levels of being</b></p>
<p>There is the intelligent part and the expedient part of the mind. The expedient part wants pleasure. It is impatient, it lies, it gives excuses. Let the intelligence function mostly of your day. Pleasure driven action is not helpful for a good life. So how do you let intelligence function? First, organize your life. Get a routine, in a routine the day loses its complexity. You have much more space in your head. You’ll make better decisions because you’ll have lots of willpower.</p>
<p>Take breaks between tasks. It’s important that the tasks are well – defined because it creates order. Checking Twitter is not a break. It doesn’t work. The rule for a break is that you’re not allowed to focus on anything for t minutes. You also want to take breaks throughout the day many times. Always remember this: if you want to be consistent, don’t burn yourself for 6 days straight. Push yourself at the end of the workday, that is 6th day. Take a break on the 7th day.</p>
<h2>Rating of perceived exertion</h2>

<p>The RPE scale is used to measure the intensity of your exercise. </p>
<p>0 – Nothing at all<br>0.5 – Just noticeable<br>1 – Very light<br>2 – Light<br>3 – Moderate<br>4 – Somewhat heavy<br>5 – Heavy<br>6<br>7 – Very heavy<br>8<br>9<br>10 – Very, very heavy</p>
<p>In most cases, exercise at a level that feels 3 (moderate) to 4 (somewhat heavy). And before the rest day, level 7 to 10.</p>

<p>The work has to be the right amount. If it is too easy, you’ll get bored. If it’s too hard, you’ll get frustrated.</p>

You can’t go hard every day. There’s a price to pay at going your max effort — Rest. The max effort implies that you need rest.

<p>The next day you should wake up feeling good because if you don’t you’re very much likely to break your consistency streak. Your workday should just be enough that you wake up feeling good. Be cautious that you don’t burn yourself too much.</p>
<p>Think of work not in terms of days but weeks. Have a goal like 40 hrs a week and if you work 3 hrs less in a day, then the next day you have to work 3 hrs extra. Take a day off every week.</p>
<p>Think of the total work done in a year if you just master discipline to stay consistent. Do not count on your willpower though. Habit is just very, very powerful than willpower.</p>
<p>Use streaks to help you keep going. I read somewhere that Jerry Seinfeld used streaks to help him write jokes.</p>
<p>Take a calendar in your app and mark the dates when you work. The benefit of this that you will not want to break the streak. I use Habitory. It hurts to break a streak and keeps you going.</p>
<h2>Progress comes in big chunks</h2>

<p>You’ll notice progress in big chunks of time that is 3 to 6 months. And every week you have to up the level incrementally right from where you are. Start from where you are. Decide where you are and be honest without comparing yourself.</p>
<p>Growth is a long-term thing. Understand this carefully or you’ll waste all your life. It’s not something that you do in a day. There will be days when you don’t feel like doing, but these are the most important days. This is where growth happens. Everyone can work when they feel like it. This is exactly where growth happens.</p>
