This is not right.</p><span id="more"></span><p>The resistance to learn the fundamentals upfront of which you may not understand the motive at the time is what lures you to skip it. Because it’s rather boring.</p><p>The problem is you don’t know what you don’t know. You cannot come up with the right questions in the beginning because you don’t have enough experience. You’ll rarely get the right answer. Asking good questions is never easy, but they are easier to answer. You might incorrectly use the concepts and you can tell that by your bad code. Although, you will get the job done eventually. </p><p>What’s the point in writing bad code that creates more problems which don’t need to exist in the first place? Making mistakes is not the same as taking a wrong turn to solve a problem. You will formulate questions in plain english if you’re not aware of the existence of features. You may find the right resource if you’re lucky. But you’ll often realize you were wasting your time working on the wrong thing. </p><p>If you think you’re learning to program by doing, that is not true because learning to program is orthogonal to learning a language. You can know how to program but not know a language.</p><blockquote>It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to. — Elon Musk</blockquote><p>You have to at least be aware of the existence of as many features as you can. And know why were they built, their pros and cons, even if you don’t know how they work. </p><p>The dopmine hits of getting the job done will make this habit stronger.  And you’ll not want to look back. I didn’t. You’ll think you’re progressing. It is indispensable to keep your eye on learning rather than finishing a project.</p><p>Recommended reading: ”How to ask good questions” <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/">https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/</a></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Is it intelligence? Obviously, you need intelligence to do great things. Also, many qualities like determination, persistence too. But you don’t start good things because you’ve got them. There is a much more important quality.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Nietzsche said, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”</p><p>Why would you start a rocket company when it’s most likely to fail? Elon Musk says, “If something’s important enough, you should try. Even if – the probable outcome is failure.” He feels the importance of starting an aerospace company. Sun will incinerate earth. There has to some percentage of people working on that problem.</p><p>Ordinary people don’t even care about that. Given they even thought that far. They’ll say it’s a long time before extinction and I’d be already dead before that.</p><p>Clearly, self-interest is a significant factor in a petty life. If you only care about yourself, how are you likely to do anything bigger than yourself? How did they come to this? I blame mostly schools.</p><p>It is the sensitivity and insight to the fact that the human race will go extinct if we stayed on earth forever.</p><p>Sensitivity and insight. Yes.</p><p>Sensitivity to problems. Problems like Climate Change.</p><p>It is also love. It is the greatest source of strength. When you love something, you unlock the capacity to endure infinite pain for the higher good, which is why Steve Jobs said “the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.” Also, “Without passion, any rational person would give up.” Love is the greatest thing. It is the ultimate answer.</p><p>The very nature of life is sensitivity, and this sensitivity is love. If you become insensitive, you’ll lose the capacity to love.</p><p>You can’t cultivate these two traits, but you can avoid the situations that gradually destroy them. Like schools, or working in big companies. Any situation with authority. We’re all born sensitive, but most teachers and parents are hell-bent on killing it. And they succeed.</p><p>How to tell if you’ve become insensitive? Simple. You’re satisfied with beliefs. So you don’t ask questions.</p><p>In schools, you’re doing what you’re told (without knowing why) else you’re punished. Also, if you’re told everything, you don’t have to think. Dependance makes you weak. (Now I don’t mean doing every damn thing from the bottom up, that’d be stupid and impossible.) All this makes you utterly insensitive.</p><p>Sensitivity is life itself. You can see that in every living thing. Plants respond to light, gravity, changes in temperature, chemicals, and even touch. And it’s not only the physical senses that you learn not to touch a hot stove. It’s also intelligence.</p><p>One of my friends in college was aggressively conventional-minded. And I say this as he’d agree with my ideas, but they’d not register in him. If it did, it would show in his actions. It’s not that they totally lost the ability to think for themselves since they do sometimes agree with certain ideas, but they’re insensitive. They don’t mind accepting bullshit. Fyodor Dostoevsky in Crime And Punishment wrote, ‘Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!‘. I’ve learned this word conventional-minded from Paul Graham. He’s right that these people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world. The link for that essay is here.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why choose hard things? In startups, it is often easier to do a hard startup than an easier one.<span id="more"></span> The competition is enormous in easier projects. They are not helpful for the community too because you’re not adding anything new. A hard startup also demands a long-term commitment.</p><!-- more --><p>It takes a decade to build a company. You must be patient. Patience is not the absence of action. It is doing things the right way. Not skipping any necessary steps. It is also timing. If you’ve solved a problem ahead of its time, you must wait. Wrong timing kills startups.</p><p>Most people are not willing to do it. So you’ll be more alone, which is going to make it even harder. But life will happen, many talented people will help you along the way. They’re willing to work on meaningful problems. Choosing to do hard things is also a filter for attracting great people.<br>The opposite is really pathetic. Although you’re demanded by big companies to do boring work, you’re also easily replaceable.</p><p>Easy is safe. Hard is dangerous. But if you want to be safe, you want to be so weak that you need protection from threats!? That is no life for a human being. You should confront danger and the unknown. The more you confront danger, the more you grow. Because it will demand more of your intelligence, energy, and other faculties. You become bigger than the danger itself. Why would you want an easier life that goes according to plan the entire way through? It is so boring. If it’s predictable, it is boring. I get disgusted with people who are like this.</p><p>In retrospect, all the interesting things that you have done were difficult. Anything given does not matter. You’re also more proud of yourself, knowing with all the disadvantages I had, at least I can move that from there to there. It makes you feel strong. In the journey, you’ll learn so much about yourself.</p><p>Because it is hard, you’ll learn to be more productive, you cannot afford to be slack and half-ass about it. And it’ll spread over other areas of your life, into your being.<br>Most good things are hard. If you have to choose between sitting and watching YouTube and going out and running. Go run. The reason you’re considering the former option is laziness. Growth happens right at the beginning of discomfort. Only when you push your limits, there is a discovery of something new. I think this is true for all domains.</p><p>Many of my friends are like this: “watch this show, it so good. Finished it? Great, now watch this one“. If you choose easy; then you can not help spending your time watching Netflix. Because what else would you do?<br>If you choose hard: you’ll need strength, courage, resilience, consistency. And if you choose easy, none of it.</p><p>In retrospect, you don’t want to die with anything left to give. It shouldn’t be a journey intending to arrive safely on your deathbed, rather with a cloud of smoke. That you’d say: ‘What a ride’!</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://kartikeyrao.com/">kartikeyrai.com</a></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about how schools and colleges have been keeping us busy and useless. It was after my 3rd year in college that I realized this.</p><span id="more"></span><p>One day, watching people giving placement exam it occurred to me: what were they to do? If up to that point you have no skills, what else will you do than to sit in college placements.</p><p>They have been keeping us busy and useless for two decades, only to be a slave in a company.</p><p>We gradually learned we need to make money. The thought of making money was never serious until the last years of college. At least for me. You make money by giving people what they want. Such a simple thing. Why were we not told this? Crazy! But to make money by being a slave that governs the lives of 99.9% of people is not a good idea.</p><p>They keep teaching bullshit, wasting our precious time, and now you gotta make money.</p><p>Everyone asks what you’re going to “be” when you grow up. For most of us, that never happened. I don’t know how the education system should be, but I know this: they don’t care about us. They only care about their rules–just follow them and don’t ask questions.</p><p>They only, only care about their rules. They will not even care if you commit suicide.</p><p>This might seem strange. Many teachers enjoy seeing a child in pain. I don’t know why, but I’ve seen this many times over the years. Perhaps because it is pleasurable for them to have someone to exercise power over.</p><p>Thinking is hard. Memorizing is easy. If they themselves never figured out how to think, tell me what happens to the children they’re teaching? Each human is unique. It is much easier for them to put them all under one system.</p><p>Of course, they’re taking a college placement job. What else are they gonna do? They gotta make money.</p><p>What a tragedy to never discover your interest. To be a human being and give away your life in a 9 to 5 job, what a waste.</p><p>After two decades of smothering, most of us die inside. We get burnt out, there’s no fire. One of my friends said, “In 12th I’d do anything I want, but now I want security”. So funny because it’s when you least need it. The truth is, their fire and uniqueness was killed. Yeah, kill is the right word.</p><p>If you’re reading this, for the time that is left, think about it. Avoid doing what is meaningless. Whatever the consequence, live with it. If it is sleeping hungry on a park bench, so be it.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It takes consistency to be good at something or to do great work in most domains. Talent is overrated; because it gives people an excuse for being lazy. Talent matters in some domains like math. But for most domains, great work is done only through consistency.</p><span id="more"></span><p>For this essay, I have assumed you already know what something big you ought to work on, and laziness is the problem.</p><p>If you have a project that will take a long time to finish — something like 4 months to years, you have to maintain a long-term motivation. Working has no intrinsic pleasure in it. If it was, it’d be awesome. It is hard to work hard.</p><p>We all can relate to working on the days we feel motivated but slacking for the most days. The reason is, this state of mind doesn’t last. This is true for all emotions. Our emotions are in flux. But consistency is a necessity, you know that you have what it takes to achieve your goals but to fail because of laziness is tragic.</p><p>Often, we procrastinate on our own projects. And the reason is there is no immediate consequence of taking a day off in the long game. But — I’ve said this in the previous post — if you waste time, then you’re the sort of person who wastes time. This is who you are — a person who wastes time. The cause of your procrastination is not separate from you. If you miss one day, you’ll miss another day. And the next day. What you are today is roughly what you’ll be tomorrow. So the person who procrastinated today will also procrastinate tomorrow. If you don’t deal with it now, it is never.</p><p>Procrastination lives off distractions. We don’t sit idle and do nothing (unless meditating ofc). You can only do one thing at a time. If we eliminate all distractions, we can beat procrastination.</p><p>Is there a gap when you look at an apple and in assigning meaning to it? It’s not that you see it and then think it’s to eat. We perceive meaning directly. There is no gap. So if you’re distracted by an apple, strictly, you will have temptations. Distraction is clearly bad, as it will either take you away or waste your energy in resisting it. But what do you regard as a distraction? If you’ve decided this is what I’m going to do, then everything else is a distraction.</p><p>You can only do one thing at a time. This is fundamental. And everything has its own inertia. This is a good thing because you want inertia if you’re working. But not so much when scrolling feeds. If you’re watching a movie, there is little chance you’d stop in the middle to pick up a book. Now it is obvious you have to be careful about what you start.</p><p>The big project you’re doing has a ‘why’ to it. It matters to you. You started working on it because of these ‘whys’. Now imagine this, if we didn’t need to sleep/eat we’d get in that higher state of mind and would work on the project non-stop and we’d be limitless for as long as we wanted.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have to take breaks and do other things that have their own effect on our state of mind. And you can’t be in multiple states. Every newly induced state has to remove the current state. You have to remind yourself every day or maybe hourly of the ‘whys’ of your project, but in doing this it’s going to become mechanical and will lose its vitality. As of now, I don’t know how to solve this problem.</p><p>The problem for most of us is we’re so fucking addicted to certain things that we have conflicting desires. You’d also want to work and watch YouTube videos. These addictions have installed default certain behaviors like checking the phone. Eliminating them is another complex topic of its own. I haven’t done it yet, so I shouldn’t talk about its solutions. But it is essential we rise above them.</p><p>Precision<br>Everything clarified and articulated becomes visible. You must know your destination with as much clarity as possible. You must determine where you are now so you can decide where to go. Precision specifies. It separates the faulty thing from all the other things. And the reason is that action flows naturally with clarity. If you don’t know, then make this your first priority.</p><p>If you identify things with clear language, they get simplified from their near-infinite complexity. If you keep them vague, you’ll not know what to work on, days will pass by and you’ll be taken by surprise.</p><p>For my startup, I was expecting it’d be easy to raise funds. This is vagueness. I actually don’t know how it will go. I realized it is not so easy to raise funds and I need a Plan B (in writing): what I’ll have to do if I can’t raise money; and when to switch to it.</p><p>And now I know the danger of not getting funded without a Plan B. It is a real possibility. If you see danger, you don’t carry on with it. It’s like if you see a snake in a room, you will definitely do something.</p><p>So write what and how you can fail. Never be vague about them. Write down what will happen if you don’t do this project. With as much precision and detail as possible.</p><p>I’m emphasizing writing them because it’s hard to be precise in thinking, it’s hard to notice the gaps. You can also hold more details in writing than in thinking.</p><p>You want pointed, specific, particular knowledge and plans because they jab your mind like a pin. You cannot ignore danger. The alternative to this single sharp pain is dull continued hope and vague failure.</p><p>Thanks to Sandeepan Paul, Kartik Mohan, Shubham Ranjan, Dipanshi Digga for reading drafts of this.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Moments before dying, we see the things that matter most to us. Life would be much better if we lived like there is no tomorrow. But we don’t actually believe that we will die soon. Why is that?</p><span id="more"></span><p>To be clear, I don’t mean that you will die tomorrow. It’s that you don’t know if you will. So you live like only doing things that matter. You’ll not waste your time then. We waste it because there’s always tomorrow in our minds.</p><p>Is it because we’re afraid of death so much that we like to keep it in a fog? Death is an unknown thing because we haven’t died yet. How can we be afraid of something which we don’t know? The fact is, we’re afraid of losing the things we know of. However painful, however petty, it’s the only thing that I know. I recommend reading this if you’re interested in this part: The meaning of death.</p><p>Do we waste our time because we’re easily satisfied with little things? But I’m not talking to those people who’re happy with their petty job and their petty life. Fuck them. You should be unsatisfied with certain things.</p><p>I’m talking about a sense of urgency to not waste your life. To never waste your time. Is it about reminding yourself every day that we’re mortal, that our life is limited? Are we aware that life is short? For people who were too lazy to click on the link:</p><p>You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as- magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p><p>So, life is short.</p><p>If you have less of something precious, you’ll be careful about wasting it. This is an axiom.</p><p>Life is long enough that every day of our life feels the same as the previous few days. You notice the difference when you remember “oh man, it’s been six years since then”. And it jabs your mind like a pin. Each day is different, and what it means is that you are not the same person every day. The change is unnoticeable, but it’s there. Don’t get surprised when your birthday is nearing.</p><p>We waste time because each singular day or hour feels insignificant. And it is. So procrastinating doesn’t feel that big of a deal. But how you live your day is how you live your life. If you waste time, then you’re the sort of person who wastes time. You’ll waste it tomorrow again. Nothing is gonna change.</p><p>Your life is not only your life but also the life of a human being. You are a member of the human race. And if you change, you are adding to the consciousness of mankind and it is not a trivial thing. What it means is that your life is precious. It’s the life of a human being. How can you stand wasting one minute of it?</p><p>So it is precious and short. That is clear.</p><p>Let’s say it is certain you’ll die in about 80 years from now. Should you still follow your biological impulse to argue with someone on Twitter? Probably not, I hope.</p><p>It is our short term impulsive nature that we waste time. When death is close our minds are suddenly focused on the things that matter most but not so much when far away.</p><p>I was watching a video in which a girl said she’ll not eat animals.</p><p>“How about fish?” her mother asked.</p><p>‘Fish? Is it an animal?’</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>‘I won’t eat that either.’</p><p>You can watch it here: “I Won’t Eat Animals,” Girl Tells Her Mother</p><p>This rejection comes from deep sensitivity. Is it possible to feel this same level of sensitivity with our time?</p><p>Let’s find out.</p><p>Let’s take arguing online for example. Is it a good idea? Does it matter if you win the argument? One heuristic to find out if something matters is to ask: Does it matter in the future? When you realize it has no meaning, you stop immediately.</p><p>Coming back to sensitivity. It comes from deep-rooted love. And if you love your life and understand its finiteness and what’s done is done — you’ll not do meaningless things. I define wasting time as doing things that are not meaningful. This is the most fundamental way to think about it.</p><p>The solution to the problem is finding meaning in your life, and it can be in your responsibility or art. Your heart will always know.</p><p>So you have to make the decision about what you’re going to do around what truly matters to you, what you love to do. Then you’ll have the same sensitivity as the little girl.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The reason that I find being consistent so hard is that I try to go hard every day and can’t sustain even a 4-day streak. Trying to kill every day is stupid.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I learned this on Joe Rogan podcast and it is life-changing, let’s say the maximum pull-ups you can do is 10. If I had a gun to your head, you couldn’t do 11. Then on the first day, you should do 5. So you’ll not be sore and can attempt the next day too. And when you’ve mastered 5, then only move to 6. And this is sustainable for months every day. Even Joe was surprised listening to this.</p><p>I always thought if I do this way I’ll waste a lot of time. But I’ll waste so much more time if I don’t follow this — and for years. Going big the first day when you feel motivated is stupid because it’s just not sustainable every day. I have wasted years not understanding this. Only incremental growth every week is sustainable every day. And you can go farther than you can imagine in a year.</p><p>This is the reason that you should start small, you can sustain it.</p><p>Every day one must go into the unknown. If not every day at least a week. By the unknown, I mean something new. When you push yourself in working out you’re going into the unknown. You’re discovering something new about yourself or what you are exploring. As Jiddu Krishnamurti said, “All knowledge is self-knowledge”. So everything you do should always have something that you haven’t done before. Then it is engaging. Unknown is fun and engaging. And happiness comes from engagement. Engagement is a necessity for consistency. If you’re not having fun, you’ll get bored fast.</p><p><b>Levels of being</b></p><p>There is the intelligent part and the expedient part of the mind. The expedient part wants pleasure. It is impatient, it lies, it gives excuses. Let the intelligence function mostly of your day. Pleasure driven action is not helpful for a good life. So how do you let intelligence function? First, organize your life. Get a routine, in a routine the day loses its complexity. You have much more space in your head. You’ll make better decisions because you’ll have lots of willpower.</p><p>Take breaks between tasks. It’s important that the tasks are well – defined because it creates order. Checking Twitter is not a break. It doesn’t work. The rule for a break is that you’re not allowed to focus on anything for t minutes. You also want to take breaks throughout the day many times. Always remember this: if you want to be consistent, don’t burn yourself for 6 days straight. Push yourself at the end of the workday, that is 6th day. Take a break on the 7th day.</p><h2>Rating of perceived exertion</h2><p>The RPE scale is used to measure the intensity of your exercise. </p><p>0 – Nothing at all<br>0.5 – Just noticeable<br>1 – Very light<br>2 – Light<br>3 – Moderate<br>4 – Somewhat heavy<br>5 – Heavy<br>6<br>7 – Very heavy<br>8<br>9<br>10 – Very, very heavy</p><p>In most cases, exercise at a level that feels 3 (moderate) to 4 (somewhat heavy).

If it is too easy, you’ll get bored. If it’s too hard, you’ll get frustrated.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtzbBqEIUAAUKXg?format=jpg&name=large" alt="alternatetext">You can’t go hard every day. There’s a price to pay at going your max effort — Rest. The max effort implies that you need rest.<p>The next day you should wake up feeling good because if you don’t you’re very much likely to break your consistency streak. Your workday should just be enough that you wake up feeling good. Be cautious that you don’t burn yourself too much.</p><p>Think of work not in terms of days but weeks. Have a goal like 40 hrs a week and if you work 3 hrs less in a day, then the next day you have to work 3 hrs extra. Take a day off every week.</p><p>Think of the total work done in a year if you just master discipline to stay consistent. Do not count on your willpower though. Habit is just very, very powerful than willpower.</p><p>Use streaks to help you keep going. I read somewhere that Jerry Seinfeld used streaks to help him write jokes.</p><p>Take a calendar in your app and mark the dates when you work. The benefit of this that you will not want to break the streak. I use Habitory. It hurts to break a streak and keeps you going.</p><h2>Progress comes in big chunks</h2><p>You’ll notice progress in big chunks of time that is 3 to 6 months. And every week you have to up the level incrementally right from where you are. Start from where you are. Decide where you are and be honest without comparing yourself.</p><p>Growth is a long-term thing. Understand this carefully or you’ll waste all your life. It’s not something that you do in a day. There will be days when you don’t feel like doing, but these are the most important days. This is where growth happens. Everyone can work when they feel like it. This is exactly where growth happens.</p>]]></content>
    
    
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The reason that I find being consistent so hard is that I try to go hard every day and can’t sustain even a 4-day streak. Trying to kill every day is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <title>How To Find Your Real Interest</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination. And when you’re obsessively interested in something, you don’t need as much determination: you don’t need to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you.<span id="more"></span>Interest helps you discover new ideas.<p>— Paul Graham</blockquote></p><p>To do great work, you need both talent and determination. But there’s a third ingredient: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.</p><p>Naval Ravikant says on Joe Rogan Experience #1309:</p><blockquote>No one can compete with you if you love to do it.Your real resume is just a catalog of all your suffering. If I were to ask you to describe your real life to yourself, when you look back on your deathbed, you’re gonna go back and say what are the interesting things I’ve done and it’s all going to be around the sacrifices that you’ve made and the hard things that you did. Anything you were given doesn’t matter.<p>You know, you have your four limbs, you have your brain, you have your head, you have your skin. That’s all for granted. So you have to do hard things anyway to create your own meaning in life. Making money is a fine one. Yes, struggle. It is hard. I’m not gonna say it’s easy. It’s really hard. But the tools are all available. It’s all there.</blockquote></p><p>Interest gives you the capacity to endure infinite pains.</p><p>Most of us don’t have this obsessive interest in something like Ramanujan in series, or Van Gogh in paintings.</p><p>If one of the possible reasons is you’re burnt out. Then it is a matter of healing, recuperating, the fallow. It is inaction for complete future action.</p><p>Or else keep trying different things.</p><p>Keep producing output rather than consumption, the real interest will show itself.</p><p>In Paul Graham’s essay on love:</p><blockquote>Always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don’t take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you’re producing, you’ll know you’re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you’re actually writing.<p>“Always produce” is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you’re supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. “Always produce” will discover your life’s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.</blockquote></p><p>Don’t spend your energy trying to find the right interest; which is comparing/judging between interests. This serves no purpose. We have a tendency to talk too much and debate and discuss and so much bullshit. The action itself will reveal the truth. Too much thinking is always pointless.</p><p>When I don’t like something my whole being rejects it. So you need to be aware of what doesn’t interest you. It keeps you going. Don’t worry that if you’re wasting time because it is probably a requirement.</p><p>Ask: Would I still be interested in learning this thing if I couldn’t ever tell anybody about it? That’s how I know it’s real. That’s how I know something I actually want.</p><p>Don’t make something harder than it has to be; meaning eliminate distractions while you’re doing it, don’t judge it or compare it. The first few hours of learning are always the most brutal, because you’re instantly confronted with the fact that, as a beginner, you suck. So the more fun you can have with it, the better.</p><p>Passion comes from success</p><blockquote>All of our emotions exist for good reason. We feel hunger to ensure we don’t starve. We feel full to ensure we don’t burst. And we feel passion to ensure we concentrate our efforts on things that reward us the most.<p>Imagine you start a dance class. You find it easy. You realise you’re getting better than others, and fast. That rising excitement you feel is your passion, and that passion makes you come back for more, improving your skills, and compounding your strengths.</blockquote></p><p>Nearly everything is interesting if you go deep enough. So pick something and give it the first 20 hrs. Start from the fundamentals and go deep. Remember the real interest will show itself.</p><p>Fun shall be the focus.<br>You got to have fun with things or you’ll drain yourself. This is really important. Fun is a necessity. You have one life, don’t give in to the belief that life is something to be suffered through, rather it is to enjoy it. Fuck the belief that if you’re having too much fun, then you’re not doing enough ‘stuff’.</p><p>“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”</p><p>— Feynman</p><p>There’s value in boredom<br>Elon Musk started reading encyclopedias because he ran out of things to read. TV was bad at the time in South Africa. Boredom is a kind of necessity for interest.</p><p>If a pencil is being sharpened all the time, soon there will be nothing left of it; similarly, the mind uses itself constantly and is exhausted. Give your mind space.</p><p>Then the practical approach is Meditation. And cut off Netflix and put limits on your Social Media usage. You want space in your head. This space is necessary for interests.</p><p>When you feel bored, try to not turn to your phone.</p><p>You don’t want your life to be like a sine wave. Acquisition and boredom. You watch one Web Series; it ends, and now you’re back to where you started — bored.</p><p>Build pockets of stillness into your life. Meditate. Go for walks. Ride your bike going nowhere in particular. There is a creative purpose to daydreaming, even to boredom.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why have goals? Why not drift aimlessly?</p><span id="more"></span><p>We are a biological mass reacting to the environment with our biological desires guiding us. Yeah, just like animals.</p><p>Humans Work. Our work makes our life meaningful. What else makes our lives more meaningful? Without it, we lose our humanity; What’s left is nihilism and trivial pleasures (Netflix).</p><blockquote>It was from this that I drew my fundamental moral conclusions. Aim up. Pay attention. Fix what you can fix. Don’t be arrogant in your knowledge. Strive for humility. Become aware of your own insufficiency — your cowardice, malevolence, resentment and hatred. Consider the murderousness of your own spirit before you dare accuse others, and before you attempt to repair the fabric of the world. Maybe it’s not the world that’s at fault. Maybe it’s you. You’ve failed to make the mark. You’ve missed the target. You’ve fallen short of the glory of God. You’ve sinned. And all of that is your contribution to the insufficiency and evil of the world.<p>— From 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson.</blockquote></p><p>After we realize our individuality, it’s important that we set our sight to something worthy of sacrifice. If not, you’re on someone else’s path. It’s okay if their values match yours.</p><p>If you can’t see what you want, then how are you going to get it?</p><p>Most people don’t set goals because they don’t want to set criteria for failure. “A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.” — Bruce Lee</p><p>Human beings are a work in progress. We’ve done very, very good in the Technology aspect. But psychologically; we haven’t changed for thousands of years. We still get attached, suffer, live in fear. It’s all quite deep and complicated; perhaps for some other post.</p><p>The world manifests itself on what you value.</p><p>Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash<br>To go somewhere with the map, you have to specify the place. You can’t go everywhere or you’ll be all over the place. There are a lot of things you could be doing. The world is a very complicated place; There are just way too many choices to handle. When you have a goal, the world loses its complexity. Because you delimit the infinite possibilities of what you could be doing.</p><p>A goal gives you movement. And for movement is life. Static is death.</p><p>When you have a goal, your brain becomes alert for tools in the world to achieve it.</p><p>We have a part of our brain called the Reticular Activating System or RAS. The main job of the RAS is to keep us safe, and so it filters out what it thinks is important or not. If the RAS thinks something is important enough, it will knock on the door of the conscious and say, “Hey, pay attention to this. It’s important!”</p><p>So the way the world manifests itself depends on what you value. And this is truly fucking amazing.</p>]]></content>
