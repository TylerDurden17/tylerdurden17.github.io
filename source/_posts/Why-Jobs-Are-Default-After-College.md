I was thinking about how schools and colleges have been keeping us busy and useless. It was after my 3rd year in college that I realized this.

One day, watching people giving placement exam it occurred to me: what were they to do? If up to that point you have no skills, what else will you do than to sit in college placements.

They have been keeping us busy and useless for two decades, only to be a slave in a company.

We gradually learned we need to make money. The thought of making money was never serious until the last years of college. At least for me. You make money by giving people what they want. Such a simple thing. Why were we not told this? Crazy! But to make money by being a slave that governs the lives of 99.9% of people is not a good idea.

They keep teaching bullshit, wasting our precious time, and now you gotta make money.

Everyone asks what you’re going to “be” when you grow up. For most of us, that never happened. I don’t know how the education system should be, but I know this: they don’t care about us. They only care about their rules–just follow them and don’t ask questions.

They only, only care about their rules. They will not even care if you commit suicide.

This might seem strange. Many teachers enjoy seeing a child in pain. I don’t know why, but I’ve seen this many times over the years. Perhaps because it is pleasurable for them to have someone to exercise power over.

Thinking is hard. Memorizing is easy. If they themselves never figured out how to think, tell me what happens to the children they’re teaching? Each human is unique. It is much easier for them to put them all under one system.

Of course, they’re taking a college placement job. What else are they gonna do? They gotta make money.

What a tragedy to never discover your interest. To be a human being and give away your life in a 9 to 5 job, what a waste.

After two decades of smothering, most of us die inside. We get burnt out, there’s no fire. One of my friends said, “In 12th I’d do anything I want, but now I want security”. So funny because it’s when you least need it. The truth is, their fire and uniqueness was killed. Yeah, kill is the right word.

If you’re reading this, for the time that is left, think about it. Avoid doing what is meaningless. Whatever the consequence, live with it. If it is sleeping hungry on a park bench, so be it.
