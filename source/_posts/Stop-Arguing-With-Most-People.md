You’re sitting with your friend and then you say something that you regard true as opposed to the mainstream view and he/she starts to fight tooth and nail to oppose you, no matter the truth.<!-- more -->

Say nationalism is stupid. Now, how many people are triggered?

When you argue/discuss with most people and if it interferes with their identity, by “identity” . . . I mean, what they’ve known all their life, and if you challenge it, they’ll lose their minds, they’ll fight to protect it.

Every point that will come out of their mouth will be to protect their identity. They’ll lose all logic to defend their identity, no matter the truth.

They cannot be reached by a rational argument. Most people are not open to reason.

Most people can’t think. They can’t comprehend Grey Areas, paradoxes and subtleties, and just wanna be told simple dumb things they can easily believe in.
