​To learn a new technology, I used to just start building projects by asking questions on the internet for every problem I came across. This is not right.

The resistance to learn the fundamentals upfront of which you may not understand the motive at the time is what lures you to skip it. Because it’s rather boring.

The problem is you don’t know what you don’t know. You cannot come up with the right questions in the beginning because you don’t have enough experience. You’ll rarely get the right answer. Asking good questions is never easy, but they are easier to answer. You might incorrectly use the concepts and you can tell that by your bad code. Although, you will get the job done eventually. 

What’s the point in writing bad code that creates more problems which don’t need to exist in the first place? Making mistakes is not the same as taking a wrong turn to solve a problem. You will formulate questions in plain english if you’re not aware of the existence of features. You may find the right resource if you’re lucky. But you’ll often realize you were wasting your time working on the wrong thing. 

If you think you’re learning to program by doing, that is not true because learning to program is orthogonal to learning a language. You can know how to program but not know a language.

<blockquote>It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to. — Elon Musk</blockquote>

You have to at least be aware of the existence of as many features as you can. And know why were they built, their pros and cons, even if you don’t know how they work. 

The dopmine hits of getting the job done will make this habit stronger.  And you’ll not want to look back. I didn't. You’ll think you’re progressing. It is indispensable to keep your eye on learning rather than finishing a project.
