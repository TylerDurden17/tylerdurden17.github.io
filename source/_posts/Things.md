Why choose hard things? In startups, it is often easier to do a hard startup than an easier one.<!-- more --> The competition is enormous in easier projects. They are not helpful for the community too because you’re not adding anything new. A hard startup also demands a long-term commitment.

It takes a decade to build a company. You must be patient. Patience is not the absence of action. It is doing things the right way. Not skipping any necessary steps. It is also timing. If you’ve solved a problem ahead of its time, you must wait. Wrong timing kills startups.

Most people are not willing to do it. So you’ll be more alone, which is going to make it even harder. But life will happen, many talented people will help you along the way. They’re willing to work on meaningful problems. Choosing to do hard things is also a filter for attracting great people.
The opposite is really pathetic. Although you’re demanded by big companies to do boring work, you’re also easily replaceable.

Easy is safe. Hard is dangerous. But if you want to be safe, you want to be so weak that you need protection from threats!? That is no life for a human being. You should confront danger and the unknown. The more you confront danger, the more you grow. Because it will demand more of your intelligence, energy, and other faculties. You become bigger than the danger itself. Why would you want an easier life that goes according to plan the entire way through? It is so boring. If it’s predictable, it is boring. I get disgusted with people who are like this.

In retrospect, all the interesting things that you have done were difficult. Anything given does not matter. You’re also more proud of yourself, knowing with all the disadvantages I had, at least I can move that from there to there. It makes you feel strong. In the journey, you’ll learn so much about yourself.

Because it is hard, you’ll learn to be more productive, you cannot afford to be slack and half-ass about it. And it’ll spread over other areas of your life, into your being.
Most good things are hard. If you have to choose between sitting and watching YouTube and going out and running. Go run. The reason you’re considering the former option is laziness. Growth happens right at the beginning of discomfort. Only when you push your limits, there is a discovery of something new. I think this is true for all domains.

Many of my friends are like this: “watch this show, it so good. Finished it? Great, now watch this one“. If you choose easy; then you can not help spending your time watching Netflix. Because what else would you do?
If you choose hard: you’ll need strength, courage, resilience, consistency. And if you choose easy, none of it.

In retrospect, you don’t want to die with anything left to give. It shouldn’t be a journey intending to arrive safely on your deathbed, rather with a cloud of smoke. That you’d say: ‘What a ride’!
