It takes consistency to be good at something or to do great work in most domains. Talent is overrated; because it gives people an excuse for being lazy. Talent matters in some domains like math. But for most domains, great work is done only through consistency.

For this essay, I have assumed you already know what something big you ought to work on, and laziness is the problem.

If you have a project that will take a long time to finish — something like 4 months to years, you have to maintain a long-term motivation. Working has no intrinsic pleasure in it. If it was, it’d be awesome. It is hard to work hard.

We all can relate to working on the days we feel motivated but slacking for the most days. The reason is, this state of mind doesn’t last. This is true for all emotions. Our emotions are in flux. But consistency is a necessity, you know that you have what it takes to achieve your goals but to fail because of laziness is tragic.

Often, we procrastinate on our own projects. And the reason is there is no immediate consequence of taking a day off in the long game. But — I’ve said this in the previous post — if you waste time, then you’re the sort of person who wastes time. This is who you are — a person who wastes time. The cause of your procrastination is not separate from you. If you miss one day, you’ll miss another day. And the next day. What you are today is roughly what you’ll be tomorrow. So the person who procrastinated today will also procrastinate tomorrow. If you don’t deal with it now, it is never.

Procrastination lives off distractions. We don’t sit idle and do nothing (unless meditating ofc). You can only do one thing at a time. If we eliminate all distractions, we can beat procrastination.

Is there a gap when you look at an apple and in assigning meaning to it? It’s not that you see it and then think it’s to eat. We perceive meaning directly. There is no gap. So if you’re distracted by an apple, strictly, you will have temptations. Distraction is clearly bad, as it will either take you away or waste your energy in resisting it. But what do you regard as a distraction? If you’ve decided this is what I’m going to do, then everything else is a distraction.

You can only do one thing at a time. This is fundamental. And everything has its own inertia. This is a good thing because you want inertia if you’re working. But not so much when scrolling feeds. If you’re watching a movie, there is little chance you’d stop in the middle to pick up a book. Now it is obvious you have to be careful about what you start.

The big project you’re doing has a ‘why’ to it. It matters to you. You started working on it because of these ‘whys’. Now imagine this, if we didn’t need to sleep/eat we’d get in that higher state of mind and would work on the project non-stop and we’d be limitless for as long as we wanted.

Unfortunately, we have to take breaks and do other things that have their own effect on our state of mind. And you can’t be in multiple states. Every newly induced state has to remove the current state. You have to remind yourself every day or maybe hourly of the ‘whys’ of your project, but in doing this it’s going to become mechanical and will lose its vitality. As of now, I don’t know how to solve this problem.

The problem for most of us is we’re so fucking addicted to certain things that we have conflicting desires. You’d also want to work and watch YouTube videos. These addictions have installed default certain behaviors like checking the phone. Eliminating them is another complex topic of its own. I haven’t done it yet, so I shouldn’t talk about its solutions. But it is essential we rise above them.

Precision
Everything clarified and articulated becomes visible. You must know your destination with as much clarity as possible. You must determine where you are now so you can decide where to go. Precision specifies. It separates the faulty thing from all the other things. And the reason is that action flows naturally with clarity. If you don’t know, then make this your first priority.

If you identify things with clear language, they get simplified from their near-infinite complexity. If you keep them vague, you’ll not know what to work on, days will pass by and you’ll be taken by surprise.

For my startup, I was expecting it’d be easy to raise funds. This is vagueness. I actually don’t know how it will go. I realized it is not so easy to raise funds and I need a Plan B (in writing): what I’ll have to do if I can’t raise money; and when to switch to it.

And now I know the danger of not getting funded without a Plan B. It is a real possibility. If you see danger, you don’t carry on with it. It’s like if you see a snake in a room, you will definitely do something.

So write what and how you can fail. Never be vague about them. Write down what will happen if you don’t do this project. With as much precision and detail as possible.

I’m emphasizing writing them because it’s hard to be precise in thinking, it’s hard to notice the gaps. You can also hold more details in writing than in thinking.

You want pointed, specific, particular knowledge and plans because they jab your mind like a pin. You cannot ignore danger. The alternative to this single sharp pain is dull continued hope and vague failure.
