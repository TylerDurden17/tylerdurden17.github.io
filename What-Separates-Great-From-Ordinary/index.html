Obviously, you need intelligence to do great things. Also, many qualities like determination, persistence too. But you don’t start good things because you’ve got them. There is a much more important quality.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Nietzsche said, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”</p>
<p>Why would you start a rocket company when it’s most likely to fail? Elon Musk says, “If something’s important enough, you should try. Even if – the probable outcome is failure.” He feels the importance of starting an aerospace company. Sun will incinerate earth. There has to some percentage of people working on that problem.</p>
<p>Ordinary people don’t even care about that. Given they even thought that far. They’ll say it’s a long time before extinction and I’d be already dead before that.</p>
<p>Clearly, self-interest is a significant factor in a petty life. If you only care about yourself, how are you likely to do anything bigger than yourself? How did they come to this? I blame mostly schools.</p>
<p>It is the sensitivity and insight to the fact that the human race will go extinct if we stayed on earth forever.</p>
<p>Sensitivity and insight. Yes.</p>
<p>Sensitivity to problems. Problems like Climate Change.</p>
<p>It is also love. It is the greatest source of strength. When you love something, you unlock the capacity to endure infinite pain for the higher good, which is why Steve Jobs said “the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.” Also, “Without passion, any rational person would give up.” Love is the greatest thing. It is the ultimate answer.</p>
<p>The very nature of life is sensitivity, and this sensitivity is love. If you become insensitive, you’ll lose the capacity to love.</p>
<p>You can’t cultivate these two traits, but you can avoid the situations that gradually destroy them. Like schools, or working in big companies. Any situation with authority. We’re all born sensitive, but most teachers and parents are hell-bent on killing it. And they succeed.</p>
<p>How to tell if you’ve become insensitive? Simple. You’re satisfied with beliefs. So you don’t ask questions.</p>
<p>In schools, you’re doing what you’re told (without knowing why) else you’re punished. Also, if you’re told everything, you don’t have to think. Dependance makes you weak. (Now I don’t mean doing every damn thing from the bottom up, that’d be stupid and impossible.) All this makes you utterly insensitive.</p>
<p>Sensitivity is life itself. You can see that in every living thing. Plants respond to light, gravity, changes in temperature, chemicals, and even touch. And it’s not only the physical senses that you learn not to touch a hot stove. It’s also intelligence.</p>
<p>One of my friends in college was aggressively conventional-minded. And I say this as he’d agree with my ideas, but they’d not register in him. If it did, it would show in his actions. It’s not that they totally lost the ability to think for themselves since they do sometimes agree with certain ideas, but they’re insensitive. They don’t mind accepting bullshit. Fyodor Dostoevsky in Crime And Punishment wrote, ‘Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!‘. I’ve learned this word conventional-minded from Paul Graham. He’s right that these people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world. The link for that essay is here.</p>
